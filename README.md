# Introduction to Explainable AI-Part1
## Introduction

The use of machine learning and AI has increased in recent years. However, continuing adoption is being hampered by some restrictions. One of the major problems with modern machine learning and deep learning algorithms is that their models are not easily interpretable or explainable. As algorithms improve in their predictive abilities, it becomes critical to understand the reasoning behind a given prediction.
A lack of interpretability and explainability in real AI applications makes it hard to trust their predictions. Providing human-friendly explanations would increase trust in machine learning systems and encourage their further use. Emerging as a critical area of study in the next years, explainable AI is now a hot topic in the AI community. This article is an introduction to a series of articles we will publish with an attempt to unbox the black-box model to increase the explainability of the decision made by AI algorithms.
